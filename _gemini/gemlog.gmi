=> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEnFmrgEbWo The UK's electricity marginal pricing system is bonkers and distorted by the price of 'natural' gas. If you're well-off you can buy solar for your home, but there are cooperatives you can buy into (but again, that assumes you can afford to buy into one.)

It's prudent to bring this site back out of the bottle.

Time to close a lot of tabs in the default browser window.

> Hence Trump concludes that [the neoliberal order] must be rigged against the “right” people and countries and sets about righting that supposed wrong to make sure that the “right” people and countries start winning again. Obviously his framework for determining the “right” people and countries is deeply racist and xenophobic, but I think it’s important to highlight that he’s taking a specifically neoliberal approach to racism and xenophobia — the damage that the racial and foreign Others are doing is economic and calls for a shift in economic policy.

=> https://matduggan.com/self-hosting-isnt-a-solution-its-a-patch/ 

> Inadvertently, self-hosting advocates may undermine their own goal of better privacy and data ownership. By promoting open-source, self-hosted tools as the solution for those concerned about their privacy, they provide an escape valve for companies and regulators alike. Companies can claim, “Well, if users care about privacy, they can use X tool.” This reduces the pressure for legal regulation. Even Meta’s Threads, with its integration of ActivityPub, can claim to be open and competitive, deflecting criticism and regulation—despite this openness being largely flowing from Threads to ActivityPub and not the other way around.
